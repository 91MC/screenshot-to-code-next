# ant-codeAI

This project utilizes AI technology to generate high-quality code for frontend frameworks such as React, Vue, and Tailwind CSS. The code generation process is powered by GPT-4 Vision and is inspired by the screenshot-to-code approach. The server-side implementation has been transitioned to Node.js, enabling the conversion of screenshots into executable code. Continuous efforts will be made to add new features.
