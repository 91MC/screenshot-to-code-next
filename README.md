## Project Overview
This project aims to provide auxiliary functionalities for frontend development, allowing the editing of source code for everyday React, Vue, and other projects. Additionally, we plan to progressively integrate ChatGPT to explore the application of generative AI in frontend development. This project is built upon the foundation of lowcode-engine, and if you are interested in the underlying principles, you can refer to the [lowcode-engine documentation](<lowcode-engine documentation link>).

## Project Focus
The primary focus of this project is the integration of ChatGPT with frontend development. We plan to enhance developer productivity through the following means, among others:
- Code generation: Leveraging ChatGPT to generate code snippets
- Code completion: Providing intelligent code completion functionality
- Code transformation: Assisting with code language conversion
- Code explanation: Providing explanations and clarifications for code logic
- Code review: Assisting with code quality review
- Code refactoring: Supporting code refactoring and optimization
- Bug detection and fixing: Helping identify and fix bugs in the code
- System design and architecture: Offering guidance on system design and architecture
- Mock data generation: Assisting in generating mock data for testing and development purposes
- Testing: Providing relevant testing assistance
- Documentation: Assisting in generating project documentation
- Content production: Supporting content creation and generation
- Job interview preparation: Providing assistance for job interviews
- Learning: Serving as a learning tool, providing relevant knowledge and learning resources

We will continue to learn and gradually implement these features in practical use, and we look forward to the future prospects.
